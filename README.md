This is the code implementation of paper "Union of Experts: Adapting Hierarchical Routing to Equivalently Decomposed Transformer". 

The code implementation of UoE model and language modeling experiments are now available.

We will also open source the remaining experimental parts of the paper. If you would like to learn more about our project, please wait. We will complete the construction of the code repository soon. 

Thank you!
